export const CoreValue = `
Personal values reflect an individual's core beliefs and guiding principles.
They should be genuine, clear, specific, and deeply resonant to the person. 
They must be stated in the positive.

<strong>To Determine Your Core Values consider:</strong>

<strong>1. </strong>Would you sacrifice other priorities to honor this value?
<strong>2. </strong>Would you be willing to incur significant costs to yourself in order to live this value?
<strong>3. </strong>How do you feel when this value is compromised, either by you or others?
<strong>4. </strong>If you had to choose between two values, would it always come out on top? 
<strong>5. </strong>Think about the actions or decisions you're most proud of. Did this value play a part in them?  
Conversely, think about regrets. Were any of them due to not honoring this value?
<strong>6. </strong>Fulfillment: Does honoring this value bring a deep sense of fulfillment? If you frequently act contrary to a stated value and don't feel any regret or discomfort, it might not genuinely be a core value.
<strong>7. </strong>External Pressures: Do you find yourself holding onto this value even when it's unpopular or inconvenient? Genuine core values often persist regardless of external pressures.
`
export const CoreValueStatement = `
A personal value statement should be genuine and deeply resonant to the person.  It should be a statement of what you believe, not what you do.
It must be <b><u>clear</u></b>, <b><u>specific</u></b>, <b><u>have some 'depth'</u></b>, and be <b><u>positive</u></b>.

<strong>EXAMPLES OF WELL-WRITTEN PERSONAL VALUES:</strong>

<strong>Self-Respectt</strong>
I uphold my self-worth by setting clear boundaries and honoring my commitments to myself and others.

<strong>Life-long Learning</strong>
I believe in continuously expanding my horizons by seeking new knowledge and experiences, understanding that growth comes from embracing the unknown.

<strong>Authenticity</strong>
I prioritize being true to myself, expressing my genuine feelings and beliefs even when it's challenging or unpopular.


<strong>EXAMPLES OF POORLY-WRITTEN PERSONAL VALUES:</strong>

<strong>Being Nice</strong>
I try to be good to people. (Vague and lacks depth; "good" can mean various things to different people.)

<strong>Knowledge</strong>
I like knowing stuff. (Too casual; lacks a clear articulation of the value's importance.)
Honesty
`
export const ValuesDnd = `
As best you can, drag and drop your values into the order of importance to you.  
The most important value should be at the top, the least important at the bottom.
`

export const DesireTitle = `
What do you dream of? What do you want to achieve? What do you want to experience?

At this stage, your Desires should reflect a state you want to experience, such as Health and Energy, Deep Connection, Abundance, Self-Esteem, etc.  You will define specific goals and outcomes later on.
`

export const DesireDescription = `
  Describe your desire.  What do you dream of?  Why?

  State your desire using only positives (do not describe it by what it is not, or by wanting to avoid something).

  Does your desire make you feel excited or enthusiastic?  
  Would achieving your desire make you feel fulfilled?
  Would achieving your desire also benefit others/your family/your community?

  ...if not, you may need to dig deeper to find a desire that does.
`

export const DesireValuesServed = `
Your desires are driven by your values.  Your values are the things you believe are important in the way you live and work.  They (should) determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to.

Therefore, your desires should be aligned with at least one of your values.  If not, you may need to dig deeper to find a desire that is.
`

export const DesireCurrentSituationGuideLine = `
What is your current situation wrt this desire? What is the current state of affairs?  What is the current status?  Where are you now?

Be honest with yourself.  If you are not honest, you will not be able to move forward.

Write in the positive, with gratitude for all you have, even if you are not satisfied with your current situation.  If you are not grateful for what you have, you will not be able to move forward.

Keep re-writing this section until 
1. you have described your current situation as truthfully as possible,
2. you have described your current situation with gratitude for all you have, and 
3. you feel a sense of relief and release when you read it.
