export const CoreValue = `
Personal values reflect an individual's core beliefs and guiding principles.
They should be genuine, clear, specific, and deeply resonant to the person. 
They must be stated in the positive.

<strong>To Determine Your Core Values consider:</strong>

<strong>1. </strong>Would you sacrifice other priorities to honor this value?
<strong>2. </strong>Would you be willing to incur significant costs to yourself in order to live this value?
<strong>3. </strong>How do you feel when this value is compromised, either by you or others?
<strong>4. </strong>If you had to choose between two values, would it always come out on top? 
<strong>5. </strong>Think about the actions or decisions you're most proud of. Did this value play a part in them?  
Conversely, think about regrets. Were any of them due to not honoring this value?
<strong>6. </strong>Fulfillment: Does honoring this value bring a deep sense of fulfillment? If you frequently act contrary to a stated value and don't feel any regret or discomfort, it might not genuinely be a core value.
<strong>7. </strong>External Pressures: Do you find yourself holding onto this value even when it's unpopular or inconvenient? Genuine core values often persist regardless of external pressures.

For example, consider:
<b>My Health and Energy</b>
I will sacrifice other priorities to honor this value.  I will incur significant costs to myself in order to live this value.  
I feel angry and resentful when this value is compromised, either by me or others. 
My Health and Energy played a part in my most proud actions and decisions and my regrets were due to not honoring this value. 
Honoring this value brings a deep sense of fulfillment. I hold onto this value even when it's unpopular or inconvenient.  
Therefore, My Health and Energy is a core value.
`


export const CoreValueStatement = `
A personal value statement should be genuine and deeply resonant to the person.  It should be a statement of what you believe, not what you do.
It must be <b><u>clear</u></b>, <b><u>specific</u></b>, <b><u>have some 'depth'</u></b>, and be <b><u>positive</u></b>.


For example:
<b>My Health and Energy</b>

"I deeply value my health and the energy it provides me. I believe that maintaining optimal health is the foundation for a vibrant, fulfilling life.
I commit to nourishing my body with nutritious foods, engaging in regular physical activity, and taking time for rest and rejuvenation. 
I prioritize self-care and listen to my body's signals, understanding that my energy levels are a reflection of my overall health. 
By investing in my health, I empower myself to live with vitality, pursue my passions, achieve my desires, and be present for the moments that matter most."

`


export const ValuesDnd = `
As best you can, drag and drop your values into the order of importance to you.  
The most important value should be at the top, the least important at the bottom.
`

export const DesireTitle = `
What do you dream of? What do you want to achieve? What do you want to experience?

At this stage, your Desires should reflect a state you want to experience, such as Health and Energy, Deep Connection, Abundance, Self-Esteem, etc.  You will define specific goals and outcomes later on.


Values -> <b>Desire</b>
`

export const DesireDescription = `
  Describe your desire.  What do you dream of?  Why?

  State your desire using only positives (do not describe it by what it is not, or by wanting to avoid something).

  Does your desire make you feel excited or enthusiastic?  
  Would achieving your desire make you feel fulfilled?
  Would achieving your desire also benefit others/your family/your community?

  ...if not, you may need to dig deeper to find a desire that does.

`

export const DesireValuesServed = `
Values Served:  Which of your values does this desire serve?  How does it serve that value?

To maintain motivation throughout your life, your desires must be driven by your values.  Your values are the things you believe are important in the way you live and work.  They (should) determine your priorities, and, deep down, they're probably the measures you use to tell if your life is turning out the way you want it to.

Therefore, your desires should be aligned with at least one of your values.  If not, you may need to dig deeper to find a desire that is.

`

export const DesireCurrentSituationGuideLine = `
What is your current situation wrt this desire? What is the current state of affairs?  What is the current status?  Where are you now?

Be honest with yourself.  If you are not honest, you will not be able to move forward.

Write in the positive, with gratitude for all you have, even if you are not satisfied with your current situation.  If you are not grateful for what you have, you will not be able to move forward.

Keep re-writing this section until 
1. you have described your current situation as truthfully as possible,
2. you have described your current situation with gratitude for all you have, and 
3. you feel a sense of relief and release when you read it.
`

export const DesireIdealGuideline = `
What would you like to happen?  What would you like to experience?  What would you like to achieve and/or have?
Describe your Ideal Scenario; what will happen and how you will feel when your desire is achieved.  

Envision a scenario that will happen when your desire is achieved.  Describe it in detail, as if you are describing a scene in a movie.  Include who, what, when, where, and how you feel.
Be specific, clear, detailed, and positive.  Write in the present tense, as if it is happening now.  

How would a person, successful at achieving this desire, act?
`

export const DesireOutcomeGuideline = `
  What is an outcome of achieving your desire?  How will you know when you achieved all, or part, of your desire?

  An outcome is likely going to be part of your ideal scenario, but it is not the same as your ideal scenario.  Your ideal scenario is a description of what you want to experience.  
  Your outcome is a description of how you will know when you have achieved (at least part of) your desire, (ie. one aspect of your ideal scenario).

Values -> Desires -> <b>Outcomes for each Desire</b>

`

export const ProperDesireOutcomes = `
The characteristics of a well-constructed outcome to your achieved desire include:

<b>1.</b> It is stated in the positive.  It describes what you want, not what you don't want.
<b>2.</b> It is specific.  It describes what you want in detail.
<b>3. </b>It is measurable.  It describes how you will know when you have achieved it.
<b>4. </b>It is achievable.  It is something you can achieve, not something you cannot.
<b>5. </b>It is ecological.  It is good for you and good for others.
<b>6. </b>It is meaningful.  It is something you really want, not something you think you should want.
<b>7. </b>It is self-initiated and self-maintained.  It is something you can do for yourself, not something you need others to do for you.
<b>8.</b> It is congruent with your values.  

`


export const DueDates = `
Due dates are important for motivation, accountability, planning, and scheduling.

Where possible, set a due date.  
If you are not sure when you can achieve your goal, set a due date for when you will decide on a due date.

`


export const EvidenceOfProgress = `
How will you know if you are progressing towards your desired outcome?  What evidence will you see, hear, and feel?

Evidence of progress is important for motivation, accountability, planning, and scheduling, and should be measurable.

They can be considered milestones on your journey towards your desired outcome.
